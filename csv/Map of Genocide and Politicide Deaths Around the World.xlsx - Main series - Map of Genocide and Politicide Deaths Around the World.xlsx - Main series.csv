"The map here shows the magnitude of the total genocide or politicide deaths between 1955-2014 as recorded by the PITF. (Note that data for Yugoslavia had been omitted from the map.) The death magnitude is a non-linear scale developed by the PITF to classify the number of people killed in each episode, as shown in the table. In the map we sum across all episodes in this period: for countries that experienced multiple episodes of genocide, we use the midpoint of the magnitude range to calculate the sum. For more information please consult the codebook for the PITF or see the table beneath the map.",,
